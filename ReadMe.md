### Hospital Emergency Room Visit Record Dashboard

## Overview

This Hospital ER Dashboard provides key insights into patient visits, satisfaction rates, wait times, and referral trends. The goal of this project is to help hospital administrators and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions to improve patient experience, operational efficiency, to analyze trends, optimize patient flow and improve service quality.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this dashboard contains anonymized patient visit records, including:

Admission/Appointment type (scheduled vs. non-scheduled)

Patient demographics (age group, race, referral department)

Wait times and satisfaction scores

Service ratings and referral statistics

The data was cleaned and transformed using Excel (Microsoft Excel) before being visualized in Microsoft Power BI.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this dashboard are:

To analyze total patient visits and their distribution across various factors.

To identify patterns in scheduled vs. non-scheduled appointments.

To track average satisfaction levels and unrated services.

To examine patient visits by week type, age group, and department referral.

To highlight yearly patient trends and waiting time distribution.

To visualize patient satisfaction levels across different races and demographics.


## Data & Metrics

This dashboard utilizes hospital ER visit records with the following key metrics:

Total Patient Visits: 9,216

Scheduled vs. Non-Scheduled Appointments: 49.96% Scheduled, 50.04% Non-Scheduled

Average Satisfaction Score: 5.47

Unrated Service Percentage: 75.10%

Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes

Referral Breakdown: 41.41% Referred, 58.59% Walk-in Patients

## Key Insights

Most patients visit the ER on weekdays (6.6K) compared to weekends (2.6K).

Adults make up the majority of ER visits, while infants and teenagers have the lowest representation.

General Practice has the highest department referrals (1,840), while Renal cases are the lowest (86).

The highest number of patient visits occurred in August (1,024), with the lowest in February (431).

Patients are most satisfied when their wait time is at its lowest, as seen in the satisfaction scale visualization.


## Dashboard Features

Interactive Filters: Users can filter by Average Wait Time to analyze patient satisfaction.

Line and Bar Charts: Show trends in total visits, age group distribution, and referral department data.

Heatmap Analysis: Displays satisfaction levels by patient race and wait time.

KPIs & Summary Cards: Highlight critical statistics like average wait time, satisfaction score, and appointment types.


## Tools & Technologies Used

Microsoft Excel: Excel for preliminary data cleaning and structuring.

Microsoft Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

PowerPoint & Paint: Screenshot editing, annotation & dashboard creation.


## How to Use

Use the interactive filters to explore different aspects of patient visits.

Identify trends in wait times, patient demographics, and service satisfaction.


## Recommendation
Data Insights and Recommendations

1. Optimize Scheduling

Since weekdays have higher patient volumes (6.6K) compared to weekends (2.6K), staff scheduling should be adjusted accordingly to maximize efficiency.

2. Reduce Wait Time

The 35.26-minute average wait time can be optimized by improving triage processes and staff allocation.

Implementing digital check-in systems could further streamline patient flow.

3. Improve Patient Satisfaction

With 75.10% of services unrated, hospitals should encourage patients to leave feedback to identify areas for improvement.

Staff training and workflow enhancements can be explored to increase satisfaction scores.

4. Enhance Referral Efficiency

Since 5,400 patients did not receive department referrals, a more structured triage system can help ensure proper patient care.

5. Targeted Care by Age Group

Insights from age group distribution can be used to tailor healthcare services, ensuring that middle childhood and teenage patients receive adequate attention.


## Conclusion

This Hospital ER Dashboard offers valuable insights into patient flow and satisfaction trends. Healthcare administrators can leverage these insights to enhance service efficiency, reduce patient wait times, and improve overall patient care quality.
